-- Enable required extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_cron";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_net";
\`\`\`

#### B. Create User Profiles Table
\`\`\`sql
-- Create profiles table

  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT,
  full_name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
\`\`\`

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.user_roles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Security definer function to check roles
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.has_role(_user_id UUID, _role user_role)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE SQL
STABLE
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
